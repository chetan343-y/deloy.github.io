        <p class="lg:text-lg">Shri. Devendra Fadnavis is presently the Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra. He served as the 18th Chief Minister of Maharashtra from 2014 to 2019.</p>
        <p class="lg:text-lg">Maharashtra, the 3rd largest state of India in terms of area and population, became the most economically advanced state with the highest industrial output (nearly 25% of the country's output) under his visionary leadership.</p>
        <p class="lg:text-lg">Fadnavis strongly believes that 'Politics is an instrument for socio-economic change' and his political career of 25 years continues to reflect the same. His capacity to work tirelessly and relentlessly comes from his mantra of 'People First'. At every step of his socio-political journey, he has been pertinacious to see equitable progress for all.</p>

        <p >An elected representative of the people of Nagpur, he was instrumental in resolving long-pending and complex land ownership issues. He is known to be a fervent advocate for the cause of equitable development of the Vidarbha region, for which he was felicitated with the prestigious Nag Bhushan Award in 2016.</p>
        <p >Shri Fadnavis holds the record of becoming the first Chief Minister of Maharashtra to complete a full five-year term in the last 47 years and only the second one in the entire history of Maharashtra.</p>
        <p >Fadnavis's tenure as the Chief Minister of Maharashtra was exemplary. People-centric inclusive governance with knowledge-driven policy making, use of technology as a key enabler, dynamic approach towards development, problem-solving, and result-oriented frameworks for project implementation were features of his transformative rule tenure.</p>
        <p >Besides serving as the Chief Minister, he held other portfolios too, such as Home, General Administration, IT, Urban Development, Law and Judiciary, Ports, and Information & Public Relations.</p>
        <p >Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan, an ambitious program that aimed at making Maharashtra drought-free, is an example of his understanding of the aspirations of people and his ability to mobilize these aspirations into a mission. The program received a tremendous response from not only the farmers but from people across all walks of life. It was a unique example where a government program turned into a people's movement. The success of the program is not only limited to the creation of 6 lakh plus low-cost, decentralized water structures across 22 thousand plus villages but the program also facilitated harmony in many villages, empowering people to join hands to mobilize resources and to find their own sustainable solutions.</p>
        <p >Fadnavis's strong inclination towards transparency and good governance was evident when he announced to enact the Right to Service Act in the very first cabinet meeting of his government. At the time, it was the first-of-its-kind legislation in the country to ensure efficient delivery of public services. Eventually, 393 services were brought online that benefited lakhs of people. Aaple Sarkar too is one of a kind grievance redressal platform started by him for ease in remedy to the common man.</p>
